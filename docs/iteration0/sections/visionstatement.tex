\section{Vision Statement}
Hotel Manager 4000 has a single goal: developing the customer base. HM4000 helps Hotels maintain a large database of customers and their preferences, in addition to performing essential management tasks. Hotel Manager 4000 enables you to manage rooms, manage bookings and generate detailed reports quickly and easily with minimal training. The overall strategy is to create value for your clients by studying their prior behavior in order to fashion a list of their future desires. Providing an added-value incentive, tied directly to sales, increases purchases among customers. Hospitality management is about growing the relationships with your guests so you can spend more time pleasing them and less time learning software.
