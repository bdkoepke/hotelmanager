\section{Vision Statement}
Hotel Manager 4000 has a single goal: developing the customer base. HM4000 provides a dual benefit of helping hotels maintain a mounting database of customers with their vacation preferences, in addition to helping hotel staff perform essential daily tasks such as room management, reservations, room service tracking, invoicing and generating detailed sales reports quickly and easily with minimal training. The overall mission is to create apparent value for the hotel by studying clients behavior in order to fashion a list of their future desires and making hotel staff daily duties as simple as possible. HM4000 can provide added value incentives, tied directly to sales, to increase purchases among clients. Hospitality management is about growing the relationships with hotel guests and HM4000 lets your hotel staff spend more time pleasing clients than learning software.

Hotel manager will attempt to provide an efficient and easy to use web interface that will be used by your staff and your customers.  We are aware that the staff of your hotel will be busy on certain periods of the year, so that it is mandatory to provide them with a tool that will make them more efficient, and their job easier. These tasks will include basic hotel management features like keeping records, manage customers, and so on.  Similarly, we will provide to your customers an easy option for searching and booking rooms.
