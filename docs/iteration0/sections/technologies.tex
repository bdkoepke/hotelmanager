Eclipse was chosen as the IDE due to the fact that it is both open source and cross-platform. Eclipse has also been promoted in previous courses, so the majority of the group is already familiar with it. Unfortunately Eclipse does not have out of the box support for Ruby, so the plugin Aptana is being used for Ruby support.

Jenkins is being used as the CI server, and is being hosted \href{http://seng403.ssh22.net/jenkins}{here}. Jenkins was chosen because it has an extremely large number of plugins and it is easy to extend. It also has support for many of the common version control systems including git. We also looked at CruiseControl.rb, but chose not to use it because it does not have a graphical reporting system. Git is being used as the version control system, and Trac is being used as the web interface to git. The git repository can be checked out using:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
git clone <username>@seng403.ssh22.net:/var/cache/git/hotelmanager
\end{lstlisting}
The trac repository can be accessed \href{http://seng403.ssh22.net/trac}{here}. We also tried the Gitlab web interface, but it was missing timeline and roadmap functionality and its bug reporting functionality was poor.

Shoulda will be used as the unit testing framework. This is because it is an extension of the built in Ruby unit testing framework Test::Unit. Unlike RSpec which encourages Behaviour Driven Development, Shoulda uses Test Driven Development which the group is more familiar with.
