\section{Requirements}
The operating systems that the system will support are windows Vista, 7, 8, and Mac OS X. These operating systems were chosen since the majority of company's and household computers will 
already have one of these installed. Making our system readily available to the vast
majority of potential clients. 

The Hotel Manager system is a web based application.  It will support the main web browsers, Mozilla 
Firefox (18.0.1), Google Chrome (24.0.1312.57), Safari (5.1.1) and Internet Explorer (9.0).  Hotel 
Manager will run on any of these versions, and continue to function with new updates.  We chose 
a web based application because our software needs to be accessible by anyone who may want to book
a room at a hotel using this system. A web application is the most effective way of accomplishing 
this as most computers already have at least one of the listed web browsers.
