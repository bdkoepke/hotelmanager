\section{Critical Success Factors}
The hotel management system must be easy to use, extendible, and scalable. These are non functional qualities that will aid users to have a better experience with the system, and developers to be able to easily extend, improve, adapt, and add features to the system without breaking its main functionality. We will also like to make the webpage scalable so that the hotel can continue to serve their users better at each stage of their growing process as a company. By allowing the hotel management website to be able to grow together with the company, we are also allowing the hotel to take care of their old and new customers so that they can enjoy of all the amenities and services that the hotel offers in the present and in the future.

The hotel manager website must be easy to use for all the users of this service. This will initially include both staff and the hotel customers. We plan on making the as simple and intuitive as possible so employees will need very little training. The website should also improve employee productivity and make it easy to do their jobs. We also want to make it easy for customers to find and book rooms. This will be achieved by focusing early on users and tasks. We will also try to leverage the current experience that staff and customers have and will try to improve upon it.

In order to be successful the system will also need to be very flexible and extensible. This is a critical success factor because we will be adding many features during each iteration of the project and we will have to make sure that adding other features is simple and easy. One such future feature will enable customers to anonymously browse the site without an account. Extensibility is also important because we may have not thought about every single use case and will have to modify the system in the future to support those new use cases.
